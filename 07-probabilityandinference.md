# Probability and Inference

## Probability:

Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 meaning the event is impossible and 1 meaning the event is certain. Probabilities can be represented graphically using bar plots or pie charts.

## Sample Space:

The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes for a given experiment or event. For example, in a coin toss experiment, the sample space is {Heads, Tails}. The sample space can be represented using Venn diagrams or tree diagrams.

## Conditional Probability:

Conditional probability refers to the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It can be represented graphically using Venn diagrams, which show the intersections of events.

## Independence:

Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event. Graphically, independence can be visualized using Venn diagrams or probability tables, where the probability of the intersection of two events is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.

## Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' theorem is a powerful tool for updating the probability of an event based on new evidence. It can be visualized using tree diagrams or probability tables, which show the updated probabilities after taking into account the new evidence.

## Discrete and Continuous Probability Distributions:

Discrete probability distributions describe the probabilities of outcomes for discrete random variables (e.g., number of heads in coin tosses), while continuous probability distributions describe the probabilities of outcomes for continuous random variables (e.g., height of individuals). Discrete distributions can be visualized using bar plots, and continuous distributions can be visualized using probability density functions or cumulative distribution functions.
