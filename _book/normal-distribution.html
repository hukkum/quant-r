<p>The normal distribution is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. It is a bell-shaped, continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical and fully determined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The normal distribution is characterized by the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is continuous and takes on all possible real values.</li>
<li>It is symmetric around the mean, which is the highest point of the curve.</li>
<li>It has a bell-shaped curve, with most of the data clustered around the mean and gradually decreasing in frequency as you move away from the mean.</li>
<li>It is fully specified by its mean and standard deviation, with the 68-95-99.7 rule describing how much of the data falls within one, two, or three standard deviations from the mean.</li>
<li>It is widely used to model many natural phenomena and measurements in the social and natural sciences.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the key properties of the normal distribution is the 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule or the three-sigma rule. According to this rule, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean. This property makes the normal distribution useful for making probabilistic statements about the data.The Normal distribution is a continuous, symmetric, bell-shaped
distribution that is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the
standard deviation (σ).</p>
<p>The mean (μ) determines the center of the distribution, and the standard
deviation (σ) controls the spread or dispersion of the data.
Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation from
the mean, 95% falls within two standard deviations, and 99.7% falls
within three standard deviations. This is known as the Empirical Rule or
the 68-95-99.7 rule.</p>
<p>The probability density function (PDF) of the Normal distribution is
given by:</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>f(x) is the probability density at point x μ is the mean of the
distribution σ is the standard deviation of the distribution e is the
base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718) π is the
mathematical constant Pi (approximately 3.141) .</p>

</h2>
<p>A unit normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is also known as the standard normal distribution or the Z-distribution. The concept of a unit normal distribution is useful because any normal distribution can be transformed into a unit normal distribution through a process called standardization. Standardization involves subtracting the mean from each data point and then dividing by the standard deviation. This transforms the data into a Z-score, which represents the number of standard deviations away from the mean.</p>

<p>The plot shows thebell-shaped curve of the distribution, illustrating how the data is
symmetric around the mean and decreases as you move away from the center.</p>
<p>The normal distribution relates to the concepts of skewness and kurtosis. Skewness refers to the degree of asymmetry in a distribution, with positive skewness indicating that the distribution is skewed to the right and negative skewness indicating that the distribution is skewed to the left. The normal distribution has a skewness of 0, indicating perfect symmetry. Kurtosis refers to the degree of peakedness in a distribution, with high kurtosis indicating a sharp peak and low kurtosis indicating a flat peak. The normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3, which is known as mesokurtic. Distributions with higher kurtosis are called leptokurtic and those with lower kurtosis are called platykurtic.</p>
