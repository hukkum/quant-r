Data analysis generally carried purposes defining problems /making decisions address problems.Examples statistics used decision-making:election season, polling organizations may ask people public whothey likely vote (e.g., Candidate versus Candidate B). maycompute various statistics come prediction likely towin election. information may presented newspapers, theinternet, media.Similarly, candidates (people behalf) may carry pollsto determine issues important public shape theirmessage accordingly. often entails analysis numerical data (e.g., fromsurveys).marketer may collect data peoples’ buying habits store (e.g., people whopurchase product also tend purchase product B) order market productsto potential customers.medical researcher might carry statistical analysis data order todetermine drug (either drug drug B) beneficial managing painassociated cancer.educational researcher may use statistical analysis data order testmodels aimed predicting academic achievement students. Theresearcher may obtain measures Mastery goal orientation, CognitiveEngagement, Self-efficacy use predictors performance onan achievement test.criminal justice researcher might interested determining kindsof individual difference factors (e.g., empathy, neuroticism, openness) areassociated increased likelihood person engage criminalactivity. researcher might obtain data number individuals andtest relationships among certain variables using statistical analysis. mightbe useful developing interventions decrease likelihood personengaging criminal activity.Legislators (people behalf) might carry statistical analyses inorder better understand allocate funds education,military, etc.can see, statistics applied many different fields address theoreticaland practical questions.

R can considered different implementation S. important differences, much code written S runs unaltered R.R provides wide variety statistical (linear nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) graphical techniques, highly extensible. S language often vehicle choice research statistical methodology, R provides Open Source route participation activity.One R’s strengths ease well-designed publication-quality plots can produced, including mathematical symbols formulae needed.

Much system written R dialect S, makes easy users follow algorithmic choices made. computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ Fortran code can linked called run time. Advanced users can write C code manipulate R objects directly.Many users think R statistics system. prefer think environment within statistical techniques implemented.
