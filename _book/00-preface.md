# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Acknolwedgement

I would like to sincerely thank my professor **Dr Howard M. Crowson ** for providing me this wonderful opportunity to compile the resource materials in R along with providing me ample time weekly for consultation and support. You can also follow him here for him invaluable resources.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to the authors of the textbook "**An Introduction to Statistical Concepts" by Hahs-Vaughn and Lomax, 4th edition**, for providing a comprehensive resource that guided our exploration of various statistical concepts and methodologies. The textbook served as an invaluable reference, helping to gain a deeper understanding of the topics and apply them in practical examples using R programming. All the example data and text references are inspired from this textbook. 

I also appreciate the developers and maintainers of the R language, R packages, and related tools for their dedicated work in providing a powerful and accessible platform for statistical computing and data analysis. In particular, we would like to acknowledge the creators of the ggplot2, psych, lavaan, and pwr, multcomp and car packages, which were instrumental in demonstrating various statistical concepts and procedures throughout this textbook and also useful for social science research.



## Conventions Used in the Book

Code chunks will be presented in a typical Markdown format as such, with the code output below:


```r
#This is a code block. 
("Hello world")
#> [1] "Hello world"
```


Finally, here is the R version I am currently using:


```r
