# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Acknolwedgement

I would like to sincerely thank my professor and academic advisor **Dr Howard M. Crowson** [@statisti] [@mikecro] for providing me this wonderful opportunity to compile the resource materials in R along with providing me ample time weekly for consultation and support. You can also [follow him here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8r94_jZaoXv9qsgFwAdPQQ) for his insightful lectures on basic and advanced statistial concepts and procedure.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to the authors of the textbook "**An Introduction to Statistical Concepts" by Hahs-Vaughn and Lomax, 4th edition**, and for providing a comprehensive resource that guided my exploration of various statistical concepts and methodologies. The textbook served as an invaluable reference, helping to gain a deeper understanding of the topics and apply them in practical examples using R programming. All the example data and text references are inspired from this textbook.

I also appreciate the developers and maintainers of the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/), R packages, and related tools for their dedicated work in providing a powerful and accessible platform for statistical computing and data analysis. In particular, we would like to acknowledge the creators of the `bookdown`[@bookdown2016], rmarkdown[@rmarkdown2020], ggplot2 [@ggplot2], psych [@psych], lavaan [@lavaan], and all other packages used throughout the guide, which were instrumental in demonstrating various statistical concepts and procedures throughout this book and also useful for social science research.

## Conventions Used in the Book

Code chunks will be presented in a typical Markdown format as such, with the code output below:


```r
#This is a code block. 
("Hello world")
#> [1] "Hello world"
```

*Italic*

:Indicates new terms, packages name, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file extensions.

> **Tip**
>
> This icon signifies a tip, suggestion, or general note.

> **Caution**
>
> This icon indicates a warning or caution.

Finally, here is the R version I am currently using:


```r

## Example Data

All the example data I have used are form the textbook[@hahs-vaughn2020]. It can be downloaded the [official website of the textbook](https://routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/9781138650558/stats4e.php) or from my [github](https://github.com/hukkum/quant-r/tree/dev/exampledata). Some of the example data compiled form other sources are only available in github.
