# Syllabus

EIPT 5023 -- Analysis of Quantitative Data I, Fall 2022

**Course Description:** This course covers descriptive and basic inferential statistics, including graphs, frequency distributions, central tendency, dispersion, probability, hypothesis testing, tests of mean differences, correlation and simple regression, and chi-square tests. Computer applications are included.

**Course Overview:** This course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to develop their knowledge and understanding of various statistical concepts and procedures. In particular, it is hoped that students will leave the course with (a) a recognition of how statistics fits within the broader (quantitative) research process, (b) an understanding of the assumptions associated with different statistical procedures and how those assumptions should guide analytic choices, and (c) an understanding of how to utilize tools (such as SPSS) in order to analyze quantitative data.

# **General Objectives:**

To be able to correctly identify variables falling at different scales of measurement.

To be able to correctly identify appropriate techniques for analyzing data when presented with variables with different measurement characteristics.

To be able to understand the assumptions associated with different statistical tests.

To be able to set up and manage databases containing variables.

To be able to carry out statistical analyses of data using SPSS.

To be able to correctly interpret the results of statistical analyses.

To be able to distinguish between null and alternative (research) hypotheses.

To be able to distinguish between a directional and non-directional hypothesis.

To understand the concepts of \"statistical significance\" and \"effect size\".

To understand the effects of sampling (e.g., size, strategies) on inferences concerning population estimates.
