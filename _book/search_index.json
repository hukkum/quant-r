This cookbook covers practical worked out examples which you can easily apply to your dataset and also includes a discussion on how the recipe is working. We will cover descriptive and basic inferential statistics, including graphs, frequency distributions, central tendency, dispersion, probability, hypothesis testing, tests of mean differences, correlation and simple regression, and chi-square tests. This cookbook is designed to facilitate graduate and post graduate students to develop their knowledge and understanding of various statistical concepts and procedures in R programming. 0.1 General Objectives This course is based upon a 3 credit semester course “Quantitative Methods” as taught in University of OKlahoma in Fall 2022. Based on the course, the objectives of the cookbook will be: To be able to correctly identify variables falling at different scales of measurement. To be able to correctly identify appropriate techniques for analyzing data when presented with variables with different measurement characteristics. To be able to understand the assumptions associated with different statistical tests. To be able to set up and manage databases containing variables. To be able to carry out statistical analyses of data using SPSS. To be able to correctly interpret the results of statistical analyses. To be able to distinguish between null and alternative (research) hypotheses. To be able to distinguish between a directional and non-directional hypothesis. To understand the concepts of “statistical significance” and “effect size”. To understand the effects of sampling (e.g., size, strategies) on inferences concerning population estimates.
