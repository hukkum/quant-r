#Preface
As a field, statistics is concerned with the analysis of numerical data (which has either
 been collected by a researcher or organization). Data analysis is generally carried out for the purposes of defining problems and/or making decisions to address problems. 
 
 Examples where statistics could be used in decision-making:

During election season, polling organizations may ask people in the public who

they are likely to vote for (e.g., Candidate A versus Candidate B). They may

compute various statistics to come up with a prediction of who is most likely to

win an election. This information may be presented in newspapers, on the

internet, or in other media.

Similarly, the candidates themselves (or people on their behalf) may carry out polls

to determine what issues are most important to the public and shape their

message accordingly. This often entails analysis of numerical data (e.g., from

surveys).

A marketer may collect data on peoples' buying habits at a store (e.g., people who

purchase product A also tend to purchase product B) in order to market products

to potential customers.

A medical researcher might carry out statistical analysis of data in order to

determine which drug (either drug A or drug B) is more beneficial in managing pain

associated with cancer.

An educational researcher may use statistical analysis of data in order to test

models aimed at predicting academic achievement in students. The

researcher may obtain measures of Mastery goal orientation, Cognitive

Engagement, and Self-efficacy and use these as predictors of performance on

an achievement test.

A criminal justice researcher might be interested in determining what kinds

of individual difference factors (e.g., empathy, neuroticism, openness) are

associated with an increased likelihood a person will engage in criminal

activity. The researcher might obtain data from a number of individuals and

test relationships among certain variables using statistical analysis. This might

be useful for developing interventions to decrease the likelihood of a person

engaging in criminal activity.

Legislators (or people on their behalf) might carry out statistical analyses in

order to better understand where and how to allocate funds for education,

the military, etc.

As you can see, statistics is applied in many different fields to address both theoretical

and practical questions. Based on interpretation of data, stakeholders can use this

information for planning purposes, the development of interventions, or gaining a

better understanding of certain phenomena.

Importantly, even if you do not carry out statistical analyses of data yourself, you still

are being influenced by others who use statistics. When you read a newspaper or

internet report that invokes statistics (often in the context of a persuasive argument),

you will often use that information when formulating your beliefs about the way the

world works and/or the decisions you make (e.g., regarding future plans, who to vote

for, etc.).

Oftentimes, people will believe an argument simply because a number or graph is

included in that argument. (They are also particularly likely to use that number when

trying to persuade other people of a particular viewpoint). Understanding how

information is obtain and analyzed (statistically) is often crucial to coming up with a

fair representation of how the world works and in making good decisions. In short,

even if you are not a producer of statistical analyses, you are still a consumer of

analyses carried out by other people or organizations. Being a good consumer requires

some level of knowledge about statistics.

Here, we see statistical

data presented concerning

graduation rates in

different states. This type

of information may be

useful in determining

where the Dept. of

Education devotes more

versus less resources.

Here, we have a public opinion poll concerning attitudes toward the death

penalty and perceptions of accountability for police misconduct.
