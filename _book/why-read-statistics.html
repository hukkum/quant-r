<p>As a field, statistics is concerned with the analysis of numerical data (which has either
been collected by a researcher or organization). Data analysis is generally carried out for the purposes of defining problems and/or making decisions to address problems.</p>
<p>Examples where statistics could be used in decision-making:</p>
<p>During election season, polling organizations may ask people in the public who</p>
<p>they are likely to vote for (e.g., Candidate A versus Candidate B). They may</p>
<p>compute various statistics to come up with a prediction of who is most likely to</p>
<p>win an election. This information may be presented in newspapers, on the</p>
<p>internet, or in other media.</p>
<p>Similarly, the candidates themselves (or people on their behalf) may carry out polls</p>
<p>to determine what issues are most important to the public and shape their</p>
<p>message accordingly. This often entails analysis of numerical data (e.g., from</p>
<p>surveys).</p>
<p>A marketer may collect data on peoples’ buying habits at a store (e.g., people who</p>
<p>purchase product A also tend to purchase product B) in order to market products</p>
<p>to potential customers.</p>
<p>A medical researcher might carry out statistical analysis of data in order to</p>
<p>determine which drug (either drug A or drug B) is more beneficial in managing pain</p>
<p>associated with cancer.</p>
<p>An educational researcher may use statistical analysis of data in order to test</p>
<p>models aimed at predicting academic achievement in students. The</p>
<p>researcher may obtain measures of Mastery goal orientation, Cognitive</p>
<p>Engagement, and Self-efficacy and use these as predictors of performance on</p>
<p>an achievement test.</p>
<p>A criminal justice researcher might be interested in determining what kinds</p>
<p>of individual difference factors (e.g., empathy, neuroticism, openness) are</p>
<p>associated with an increased likelihood a person will engage in criminal</p>
<p>activity. The researcher might obtain data from a number of individuals and</p>
<p>test relationships among certain variables using statistical analysis. This might</p>
<p>be useful for developing interventions to decrease the likelihood of a person</p>
<p>engaging in criminal activity.</p>
<p>Legislators (or people on their behalf) might carry out statistical analyses in</p>
<p>order to better understand where and how to allocate funds for education,</p>
<p>the military, etc.</p>
<p>As you can see, statistics is applied in many different fields to address both theoretical</p>
<p>and practical questions. Based on interpretation of data, stakeholders can use this</p>
<p>information for planning purposes, the development of interventions, or gaining a</p>
<p>better understanding of certain phenomena.</p>
<p>Importantly, even if you do not carry out statistical analyses of data yourself, you still</p>
<p>are being influenced by others who use statistics. When you read a newspaper or</p>
<p>internet report that invokes statistics (often in the context of a persuasive argument),</p>
<p>you will often use that information when formulating your beliefs about the way the</p>
<p>world works and/or the decisions you make (e.g., regarding future plans, who to vote</p>
<p>for, etc.).</p>
<p>Oftentimes, people will believe an argument simply because a number or graph is</p>
<p>included in that argument. (They are also particularly likely to use that number when</p>
<p>trying to persuade other people of a particular viewpoint). Understanding how</p>
<p>information is obtain and analyzed (statistically) is often crucial to coming up with a</p>
<p>fair representation of how the world works and in making good decisions. In short,</p>
<p>even if you are not a producer of statistical analyses, you are still a consumer of</p>
<p>analyses carried out by other people or organizations. Being a good consumer requires</p>
<p>some level of knowledge about statistics.</p>
<p>Here, we see statistical</p>
<p>data presented concerning</p>
<p>graduation rates in</p>
<p>different states. This type</p>
<p>of information may be</p>
<p>useful in determining</p>
<p>where the Dept. of</p>
<p>Education devotes more</p>
<p>versus less resources.</p>

<p>Here, we have a public opinion poll concerning attitudes toward the death</p>
<p>penalty and perceptions of accountability for police misconduct.</p>

<p>#R and R Studio</p>
<p>##R
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.</p>
<p>R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.</p>
<p>One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.</p>
<p>R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes</p>
<p>an effective data handling and storage facility,
a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.
The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.</p>
<p>R, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.</p>
<p>Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it as an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.</p>
<p>R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.</p>

<p>RStudio is an integrated development environment for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using a web browser.
