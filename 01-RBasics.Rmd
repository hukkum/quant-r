# R Basics

This sections covers everything you need to get run statistical analysis using R. Just like other programming language, R also has a base package and an Integrated Development Environment. Base package is what you need to run your R code in your computer. R Studio is an IDE developed specifically focussing on development of R programs and packages.

## Installing R base package.

R base package can be downloaded from [official website](https://cran.r-project.org/) of R. Once, you enter inside the website select the package for your operating system, download the file and install it. To ensure R is successfully installed, you should be able to run it from your command prompt or terminal using R command. Type q() to quit R console.

    Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
    'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
    Type 'q()' to quit R.

### Download R studio

Well, we do not need to do everything from command or terminal. R community has also a fully fledged development environment called R Studio which is free to use and very user friendly to work in R. You can download R studio from [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

This tutorial will help you understand the basic overview and components of R studio.

## R Packages

While R is simply a statistically programming language, the R packages developed by R community has been one of the key reason of its robustness, reproducibility and flexibility. Many statistics programmers have developed 100s of packages which we can run even complex statistics functions with single line of code.

## R Console

## Getting Help

Here are few useful syntax to ask for help

     
    {Get help for an object, in this case for the –-plot– function. 
    ?plot  #You can also type: help(plot)

    #Search the help pages for anything that has the word "regression". 
    ??regression #You can also type:  help.search("regression")

    #Search the word "age" in the objects available in the current R session.
     apropos("age")
    help(package=car) # View documentation in package ‘car’. You can also type: library(help="car“)
    help(DataABC) # Access codebook for a dataset called ‘DataABC’ in the package ABC
    args(log) # Description of the command.}
