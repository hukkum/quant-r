# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Acknolwedgement

I would like to thank my professor Dr C for providing me this wonderful opportunity to ocmpile the resource materials in R.

## Conventions Used in the Book

Code chunks will be presented in a typical Markdown format as such, with the code output below:

```{runif(n = 20, min = 0, max = 100)}
```

When using commands outside of base R, the loading of the parent package will be explicitly shown to avoid confusion:

```{li}
```

Typically in longer chains of code, I will use `%>%` from `magrittr` as a pipe. This is usually standard practice in code using packages from the `tidyverse` so it's a good habit to start using it.

Finally, here is the R version I am currently using:

```{r}
version
```
